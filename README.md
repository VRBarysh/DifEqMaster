# DifEqMaster
A personal C++-based framework for solving some time-domain equation systems

## Introduction
This project began in 2002 as an attempt to summarize and systematize some equation solvers that I've made for simulating a number of free electronic devices. I wanted to put some stanalone code for simulating excitation processes in free electron lasers and backward wave oscillators under a universal platform. That C++ Builder based platform helped me with setting a myriad of parameters, following the simulation process in real-time and presenting the result graphs in a more unified and convenient way. Equations for other laser systems were added for simulation in the following years with general focus being shifted into solid state laser structures with 1D and 2D distributed feedback. Various tools and techniques were utilized too smooth both computation process and interpretation of the results. Some notable additions include multithreading, FFT-based spectrum analysis, particle swarm techniques for automatic optimization of laser parameters. Combined results of this project became the basis of my 2004 Master and 2009 Ph.D. deegrees as well as over 20 published articles in peer-reviewed jounals and conference speeches from 2004 to 2023.
